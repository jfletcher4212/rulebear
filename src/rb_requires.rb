# This file contains all the requires for the RuleBear SketchUp plugin.
# All these requires point to a folder "RuleBear" on the user's desktop.
# Due to SketchUp's limited permissions, unable to write to Plugins folder.
# RuleBear needs: 
#   This file in the Plugins folder.
#   All other RuleBear files are in this folder
#   New RuleBear rules are in the folder on the desktop.
