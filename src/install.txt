File path edits:
  In order to make this plugin work, all file paths that reference a specific user need to be changed for the user of the computer on which this plugin is installed.
  Example,change $rb_filepath = "C:\\Users\\Maxine\\Desktop\\RuleBear" to the current User's file path (usually user name only needs to be changed)
  These are the files which need the path changed:
    menu.rb      # line 12
    rulebear.rb  #lines 18, 21, and 22
